The term Material includes everything that influences what the surface
of a 3D model looks like: The color, texture, shininess, and
opacity/transparency. Plain coloring is covered in [Hello
Node](../../jme3/beginner/hello_node). Loading models that come with
materials is covered in [Hello
Asset](../../jme3/beginner/hello_asset). In this tutorial you learn
to create and use custom JME3 Material Definitions.

You should see

-   Left -- A cube with a brown monkey texture.

-   Right -- A translucent monkey picture in front of a shiny bumpy
    rock.

Move around with the WASD keys to have a closer look at the
translucency, and the rock's bumpiness.

Simple Unshaded Texture
=======================

Typically you want to give objects in your scene textures: It can be
rock, grass, brick, wood, water, metal, paper... A texture is a normal
image file in JPG or PNG format. In this example, you create a box with
a simple unshaded Monkey texture as material.

```java
    /** A simple textured cube -- in good MIP map quality. */
    Box cube1Mesh = new Box( 1f,1f,1f);
    Geometry cube1Geo = new Geometry("My Textured Box", cube1Mesh);
    cube1Geo.setLocalTranslation(new Vector3f(-3f,1.1f,0f));
    Material cube1Mat = new Material(assetManager,
        "Common/MatDefs/Misc/Unshaded.j3md");
    Texture cube1Tex = assetManager.loadTexture(
        "Interface/Logo/Monkey.jpg");
    cube1Mat.setTexture("ColorMap", cube1Tex);
    cube1Geo.setMaterial(cube1Mat);
    rootNode.attachChild(cube1Geo);
```

Here is what we did: to create a textured box:

1.  Create a Geometry `cube1Geo` from a Box mesh `cube1Mesh`.

2.  Create a Material `cube1Mat` based on jME3's default `Unshaded.j3md`
    material definition.

3.  Create a texture `cube1Tex` from the `Monkey.jpg` file in the
    `assets/Interface/Logo/` directory of the project.

4.  Load the texture `cube1Tex` into the `ColorMap` layer of the
    material `cube1Mat`.

5.  Apply the material to the cube, and attach the cube to the rootnode.

Transparent Unshaded Texture
============================

`Monkey.png` is the same texture as `Monkey.jpg`, but with an added
alpha channel. The alpha channel allows you to specify which areas of
the texture you want to be opaque or transparent: Black areas of the
alpha channel remain opaque, gray areas become translucent, and white
areas become transparent.

For a partially translucent/transparent texture, you need:

-   A Texture with alpha channel

-   A Texture with blend mode of `BlendMode.Alpha`

-   A Geometry in the `Bucket.Transparent` render bucket.\
    This bucket ensures that the transparent object is drawn on top of
    objects behind it, and they show up correctly under the transparent
    parts.

```java
    /** A translucent/transparent texture, similar to a window frame. */
    Box cube2Mesh = new Box( 1f,1f,0.01f);
    Geometry cube2Geo = new Geometry("window frame", cube2Mesh);
    Material cube2Mat = new Material(assetManager,
    "Common/MatDefs/Misc/Unshaded.j3md");
    cube2Mat.setTexture("ColorMap",
        assetManager.loadTexture("Textures/ColoredTex/Monkey.png"));
    cube2Mat.getAdditionalRenderState().setBlendMode(BlendMode.Alpha);  // !
    cube2Geo.setQueueBucket(Bucket.Transparent);                        // !
    cube2Geo.setMaterial(cube2Mat);
    rootNode.attachChild(cube2Geo);
```

For non-transparent objects, the drawing order is not so important,
because the z-buffer already keeps track of whether a pixel is behind
something else or not, and the color of an opaque pixel doesn't depend
on the pixels under it, this is why opaque Geometries can be drawn in
any order.

What you did for the transparent texture is the same as before, with
only one added step for the transparency.

1.  Create a Geometry `cube2Geo` from a Box mesh `cube2Mesh`. This Box
    Geometry is flat upright box (because z=0.01f).

2.  Create a Material `cube2Mat` based on jME3's default `Unshaded.j3md`
    material definition.

3.  Create a texture `cube2Tex` from the `Monkey.png` file in the
    `assets/Textures/ColoredTex/` directory of the project. This PNG
    file must have an alpha layer.

4.  **Activate transparency in the material by setting the blend mode to
    Alpha.**

5.  **Set the QueueBucket of the Geometry to `Bucket.Transparent`.**

6.  Load the texture `cube2Tex` into the `ColorMap` layer of the
    material `cube2Mat`.

7.  Apply the material to the cube, and attach the cube to the rootnode.

Shininess and Bumpiness
=======================

But textures are not all. Have a close look at the shiny sphere -- you
cannot get such a nice bumpy material with just a plain texture. You see
that JME3 also supports so-called Phong-illuminated materials:

In a lit material, the standard texture layer is refered to as
*DiffuseMap*, any material can use this layer. A lit material can
additionally have lighting effects such as *Shininess* used together
with the *SpecularMap* layer and *Specular* color. And you can even get
a realistically bumpy or cracked surface with help of the *NormalMap*
layer.

Let's have a look at the part of the code example where you create the
shiny bumpy rock.

1.  Create a Geometry from a Sphere shape. Note that this shape is a
    normal smooth sphere mesh.

    ```java
        Sphere sphereMesh = new Sphere(32,32, 2f);
        Geometry sphereGeo = new Geometry("Shiny rock", sphereMesh);
    ```

    a.  (Only for Spheres) Change the sphere's TextureMode to make the
        square texture project better onto the sphere.

        ```java
            sphereMesh.setTextureMode(Sphere.TextureMode.Projected);
        ```

    b.  You must generate TangentBinormals for the mesh so you can use
        the NormalMap layer of the texture.

        ```java
            TangentBinormalGenerator.generate(sphereMesh);
        ```

2.  Create a material based on the `Lighting.j3md` default material.

    ```java
        Material sphereMat = new Material(assetManager,
            "Common/MatDefs/Light/Lighting.j3md");
    ```

    a.  Set a standard rocky texture in the `DiffuseMap` layer.

    ![Pond.jpg](https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/raw/445f7ed010199d30c484fe75bacef4b87f2eb38e/jme3-testdata/src/main/resources/Textures/Terrain/Pond/Pond.jpg)

    ```java
        sphereMat.setTexture("DiffuseMap",
            assetManager.loadTexture("Textures/Terrain/Pond/Pond.jpg"));
    ```

    b.  Set the `NormalMap` layer that contains the bumpiness. The
        NormalMap was generated for this particular DiffuseMap with a
        special tool (e.g. Blender).

    ![Pond\_normal.png](https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/raw/445f7ed010199d30c484fe75bacef4b87f2eb38e/jme3-testdata/src/main/resources/Textures/Terrain/Pond/Pond_normal.png)

    ```java
        sphereMat.setTexture("NormalMap",
            assetManager.loadTexture("Textures/Terrain/Pond/Pond_normal.png"));
    ```

    c.  Set the Material's Shininess to a value between 1 and 128. For a
        rock, a low fuzzy shininess is appropriate. Use material colors
        to define the shiny Specular color.

    ```java
        sphereMat.setBoolean("UseMaterialColors",true);
        sphereMat.setColor("Diffuse",ColorRGBA.White);  // minimum material color
        sphereMat.setColor("Specular",ColorRGBA.White); // for shininess
        sphereMat.setFloat("Shininess", 64f); // [1,128] for shininess
    ```

3.  Assign your newly created material to the Geometry.

    ```java
        sphereGeo.setMaterial(sphereMat);
    ```

4.  Let's move and rotate the geometry a bit to position it better.

    ```java
        sphereGeo.setLocalTranslation(0,2,-2); // Move it a bit
        sphereGeo.rotate(1.6f, 0, 0);          // Rotate it a bit
        rootNode.attachChild(sphereGeo);
    ```

Remember that any Lighting.j3md-based material requires a light source,
as shown in the full code sample above.

:::note
To deactivate Shininess, do not set `Shininess` to 0, but instead set
the `Specular` color to `ColorRGBA.Black`.
:::

Default Material Definitions
============================

As you have seen, you can find the following default materials in
`jme/core-data/Common/MatDefs/…`.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col/>
<col/>
<col/>
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Default Definition</th>
<th>Usage</th>
<th>Parameters</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><code>Misc/Unshaded.j3md</code></p></td>
<td><p>Colored: Use with mat.setColor() and ColorRGBA.<br />
Textured: Use with mat.setTexture() and Texture.</p></td>
<td><p>Color : Color<br />
ColorMap : Texture2D</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><code>Light/Lighting.j3md</code></p></td>
<td><p>Use with shiny Textures, Bump- and NormalMaps textures.<br />
Requires a light source.</p></td>
<td><p>Ambient, Diffuse, Specular : Color<br />
DiffuseMap, NormalMap, SpecularMap : Texture2D<br />
Shininess : Float</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

For a game, you create custom Materials based on these existing
MaterialDefintions -- as you have just seen in the example with the
shiny rock's material.

Exercises
=========

Exercise 1: Custom .j3m Material
--------------------------------

Look at the shiny rocky sphere above again. It takes several lines to
create and set the Material.

-   Note how it loads the `Lighting.j3md` Material definition.

-   Note how it sets the `DiffuseMap` and `NormalMap` to a texture path.

-   Note how it activates `UseMaterialColors` and sets `Specular` and
    `Diffuse` to 4 float values (RGBA color).

-   Note how it sets `Shininess` to 64.

If you want to use one custom material for several models, you can store
it in a .j3m file, and save a few lines of code every time.

You create a j3m file as follows:

1.  Create a plain text file `assets/Materials/MyCustomMaterial.j3m` in
    your project directory, with the following content:

        Material My shiny custom material : Common/MatDefs/Light/Lighting.j3md {
             MaterialParameters {
                DiffuseMap : Textures/Terrain/Pond/Pond.jpg
                NormalMap : Textures/Terrain/Pond/Pond_normal.png
                UseMaterialColors : true
                Specular : 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0
                Diffuse : 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0
                Shininess : 64.0
             }
        }

    -   Note that `Material` is a fixed keyword.

    -   Note that `My shiny custom material` is a String that you can
        choose to describe the material.

    -   Note how the code sets all the same properties as before!

2.  In the code sample, comment out the eight lines that have
    `sphereMat` in them.

3.  Below this line, add the following line:

    ```java
    sphereGeo.setMaterial((Material) assetManager.loadMaterial(
        "Materials/MyCustomMaterial.j3m"));
    ```

4.  Run the app. The result is the same.

Using this new custom material `MyCustomMaterial.j3m` only takes one
line. You have replaced the eight lines of an on-the-fly material
definition with one line that loads a custom material from a file. Using
.j3m files is very handy if you use the same material often.

Exercise 2: Bumpiness and Shininess
-----------------------------------

Go back to the bumpy rock sample above:

1.  Comment out the DiffuseMap line, and run the app. (Uncomment it
    again.)

    -   Which property of the rock is lost?

2.  Comment out the NormalMap line, and run the app. (Uncomment it
    again.)

    -   Which property of the rock is lost?

3.  Change the value of Shininess to values like 0, 63, 127.

    -   What aspect of the Shininess changes?

Conclusion
==========

You have learned how to create a Material, specify its properties, and
use it on a Geometry. You know how to load an image file (.png, .jpg) as
texture into a material. You know to save texture files in a subfolder
of your project's `assets/Textures/` directory.

You have also learned that a material can be stored in a .j3m file. The
file references a built-in MaterialDefinition and specifies values for
properties of that MaterialDefinition. You know to save your custom .j3m
files in your project's `assets/Materials/` directory.

Now that you know how to load models and how to assign good-looking
materials to them, let's have a look at how to animate models in the
next chapter, [Hello
Animation](../../jme3/beginner/hello_animation).
