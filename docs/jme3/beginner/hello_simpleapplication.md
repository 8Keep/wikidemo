**Prerequisites:** This tutorial assumes that you have [downloaded the
jMonkeyEngine SDK](../../documentation).

In this tutorial series, we assume that you use the jMonkeyEngine
[SDK](../../sdk). As an intermediate or advanced Java developer, you
will quickly see that, in general, you can develop jMonkeyEngine code in
any integrated development environment (NetBeans IDE, Eclipse, IntelliJ)
or even from the [command
line](../../jme3/simpleapplication_from_the_commandline).

OK, let's get ready to create our first jMonkeyEngine3 application.

Create a project

In the jMonkeyEngine SDK:

1.  Choose `File > New > Project` from the main menu.

2.  In the New Project wizard, select the template `JME3 Basic Game`.

3.  Click Next.

    a.  Specify a project name, e.g. "HelloWorldTutorial".

    b.  Specify a path where to store your new project, e.g. a
        `jMonkeyProjects` directory in your home directory.

4.  Click Finish.

This will create a basic jme3 application for an easy start with jme3.
You can click the run button to run it: You will see a blue cube. If you
have questions, read more about [Project
Creation](../../sdk/project_creation) here.

:::note
We recommend to go through the steps yourself, as described in the
tutorials. Alternatively, you can create a project based on the
[JmeTests](../../sdk/sample_code) template in the jMonkeyEngine SDK.
It will create a project that already contains the `jme3test.helloworld`
samples (and many others). For example, you can use the JmeTests project
to verify whether you got the solution right.
:::

Extend SimpleApplication
----------

For this tutorial, you need a jme3test.helloworld package in your
project, with the file HelloJME3.java in it.

In the jMonkeyEngine SDK:

1.  In the `Source Packages` node of your project, RMB select the
    "mygame" package.

    a.  Choose: `Refactor Rename`

    b.  Enter the New Name: `jme3test.helloworld`

    c.  Click Refactor when ready.

2.  In the newly refactored package, RMB select the `Main.java` class.

    a.  Choose: `Refactor Rename`

    b.  Enter the New Name: `HelloJME3`

    c.  Click Refactor when ready.

You follow this same basic procedure for the remaining tutorials.

:::note
The remaining tutorials all use the same `jme3test.helloworld` package.
Just refactor the "Main.java" class name to the tutorial examples class
name rather than creating a new project for each.
:::

### Code Sample
---------

Replace the contents of the HelloJME3.java file with the following code.

```java
package jme3test.helloworld;

import com.jme3.app.SimpleApplication;
import com.jme3.material.Material;
import com.jme3.scene.Geometry;
import com.jme3.scene.shape.Box;
import com.jme3.math.ColorRGBA;

/** Sample 1 - how to get started with the most simple JME 3 application.
 * Display a blue 3D cube and view from all sides by
 * moving the mouse and pressing the WASD keys. */
public class HelloJME3 extends SimpleApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args){
        HelloJME3 app = new HelloJME3();
        app.start(); // start the game
    }

    @Override
    public void simpleInitApp() {
        Box b = new Box(1, 1, 1); // create cube shape
        Geometry geom = new Geometry("Box", b);  // create cube geometry from the shape
        Material mat = new Material(assetManager,
          "Common/MatDefs/Misc/Unshaded.j3md");  // create a simple material
        mat.setColor("Color", ColorRGBA.Blue);   // set color of material to blue
        geom.setMaterial(mat);                   // set the cube's material
        rootNode.attachChild(geom);              // make the cube appear in the scene
    }
}
```

RMB select the `HelloJME3` class and choose `Run`. If a jME3 settings
dialog pops up, confirm the default settings.

1.  You should see a simple window displaying a 3D cube.

2.  Press the W A S D keys and move the mouse to navigate around.

3.  Look at the FPS text and object count information in the bottom
    left. You will use this information during development, and you will
    remove it for the release. (To read the numbers correctly, consider
    that the 14 lines of text counts as 14 objects with 914 vertices.)

4.  Press Esc to close the application.

Congratulations! Now let's find out how it works!

Understanding the Code
======================

The code above has initialized the scene, and started the application.

Start the SimpleApplication
---------------------------

Look at the first line. Your HelloJME3.java class extends
`com.jme3.app.SimpleApplication`.

```java
public class HelloJME3 extends SimpleApplication {
  // your code...
}
```

Every JME3 game is an instance of the `com.jme3.app.SimpleApplication`
class. The SimpleApplication class is the simplest example of an
application: It manages a 3D scene graph, checks for user input, updates
the game state, and automatically draws the scene to the screen. These
are the core features of a game engine. You extend this simple
application and customize it to create your game.

You start every JME3 game from the main() method, as every standard Java
application:

1.  Instantiate your `SimpleApplication`-based class

2.  Call the application's `start()` method to start the game engine.

```java
    public static void main(String[] args){
        HelloJME3 app = new HelloJME3(); // instantiate the game
        app.start();                     // start the game!
    }
```

The `app.start();` line opens the application window. Let's learn how
you put something into this window (the scene) next.

If you are unfamiliar with the vocabulary, read more about [the Scene
Graph](../../jme3/the_scene_graph) here.

Initialize the Scene
--------------------

Look at rest of the code sample. The `simpleInitApp()` method is
automatically called once at the beginning when the application starts.
Every JME3 game must have this method. In the `simpleInitApp()` method,
you load game objects before the game starts.

```java
    public void simpleInitApp() {
       // your initialization code...
    }
```

The initialization code of a blue cube looks as follows:

```java
    public void simpleInitApp() {
        Box b = new Box(1, 1, 1); // create a 1x1x1 box shape
        Geometry geom = new Geometry("Box", b);  // create a cube geometry from the box shape
        Material mat = new Material(assetManager,
          "Common/MatDefs/Misc/Unshaded.j3md");  // create a simple material
        mat.setColor("Color", ColorRGBA.Blue);   // set color of material to blue
        geom.setMaterial(mat);                   // set the cube geometry 's material
        rootNode.attachChild(geom);              // make the cube geometry appear in the scene
    }
```

A typical JME3 game has the following initialization process:

1.  You initialize game objects:

    -   You create or load objects and position them.

    -   You make objects appear in the scene by attaching them to the
        `rootNode`.

    -   **Examples:** Load player, terrain, sky, enemies, obstacles,
        ..., and place them in their start positions.

2.  You initialize variables:

    -   You create variables to track the game state.

    -   You set variables to their start values.

    -   **Examples:** Set the `score` to 0, set `health` to 100%, ...

3.  You initialize keys and mouse actions:

    -   The following input bindings are pre-configured:

        -   W A S D keys -- Move around in the scene

        -   Mouse movement and arrow keys -- Turn the camera

        -   Esc key -- Quit the game

    -   Define your own additional keys and mouse click actions.

    -   **Examples:** Click to shoot, press Space to jump, ...

The Future of SimpleApplication
===============================

There are plans to change SimpleApplication. Sometime back it was
decided that we should really re-factor the Application class.
SimpleApplication especially is a mess of "magic" protected fields that
on the one hand makes it really easy to slam some simple one-class
application together, but on the other hand does new users no favors
because they have no idea where \'cam\' and \'assetManager\' come from.
Unfortunately, lots of code refers to Application and it's tough to
change...​ especially the app states.

So, we hatched a plan to convert the Application class to an interface.
This would give us some freedom to iterate on a new set of application
base classes. You can read about the changes
[here](https://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/t/jmonkeyengine-3-1-alpha-4-released/35478).
As said before we are envisioning a better design that is not enforced
today, but that is already usable.

If you look at SimpleApplication default constructor you will understand
how it works.

```java
public SimpleApplication() {   
    this(new StatsAppState(), new FlyCamAppState(), new AudioListenerState(), new DebugKeysAppState());}
```

Basically the application is injected upon construction with the default
AppStates. Let's look at the second constructor.

```java
public SimpleApplication( AppState... initialStates ) {   
    super(initialStates);
}
```

It allows you to specify what AppState you want for your application. So
SimpleApplication is handy for test projects (I very often use it as is)
but I recommend for a full blown-game to use it like this:

```java
public class MyGame extends SimpleApplication {

    public MyGame(){
         super(new MyCustomSate(), new AnotherState(), ....);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyGame app = new MyGame();
        app.start();
    }

}
```

Then have all logic implemented in
[AppStates](../../jme3/advanced/application_states) and your
SimpleApplication will never change much, except when you want to add a
bootstrap AppState (or maybe you can have an AppState that manages
AppStates...​), SimpleApplication is just the list of states you are
using.

In future versions, all the code in SimpleApplication will be refactored
in AppStates (InputHandlingState, RenderAppState, whatever) and you will
decide what you want to use. However, for legacy sake we kept the code
as is for now.

If you follow this recommendation, when the changes are finalized, you
will only need to do a few things different from now to make your old
apps work and to create new ones.

a.  Extend BaseApplication rather than SimpleApplication when creating
    new apps.

b.  Update your existing apps by changing SimpleApplication to
    BaseApplication in your main class.

c.  Change any references you have made to SimpleApplication's protected
    fields.

    For example, rather than turning off the FlyCam() like so,

    ```java
    flyCam.setEnabled(false);
    ```

    You would just leave the statement `new FlyCamAppState()` out of the
    constructor instead.

SimpleApplication will be around for some time as it will take time for
people to migrate to BaseApplication, but AppStates make life easier
anyway so you may as well start using them.

Conclusion
---------

You have learned that a SimpleApplication is a good starting point
because it provides you with:

-   A `simpleInitApp()` method where you create objects.

-   A `rootNode` where you attach objects to make them appear in the
    scene.

-   Useful default input settings that you can use for navigation in the
    scene.

When developing a game application, you want to:

1.  Initialize the game scene

2.  Trigger game actions

3.  Respond to user input.

The now following tutorials teach how you accomplish these tasks with
the jMonkeyEngine 3.

Continue with the [Hello Node](../../jme3/beginner/hello_node)
tutorial, where you learn more details about how to initialize the game
world, also known as the scene graph.
