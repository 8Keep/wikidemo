Panel Class
===========

The Panel class extends Element and, like the Label class, it's only
purpose is to provide:

1.  The 3 standard constructors as shown in the [Quick Start
    Guide](../../../jme3/contributions/tonegodgui/quickstart)

2.  Default style information

**Constructor 1:**

```java
/** Parameters:
  * Screen screen,
  * String UID,
  * Vector2f position
  */

Panel panel = new Panel(screen, “panel”, new Vector2f(15, 15));
```

**Constructor 2:**

```java
/** Additional Parameter:
  * Vector2f dimensions  */

Panel panel = new Panel(screen, “panel”, new Vector2f(15, 15),
    new Vector2f(400, 300)
);
```

**Constructor 3:**

```java
/** Additional Parameters:
  * Vector4f resizeBorders,
  * String defaultImg
  */

Panel panel = new Panel(screen, “panel”, new Vector2f(15, 15), new Vector2f(400, 300),
    new Vector4f(14,14,14,14),
    “tonegod/gui/style/def/Window/panel_x.png”
);
```

The Panel class creates a resizable, movable panel
([Window](../../../jme3/contributions/tonegodgui/window) without a
dragbar). The entire panel is clickable for moving unless otherwise
covered by added child Elements that have not called:

```java
setIgnoreMouse(true);
```

You can disable any of the default behaviors of the Panel class by using
the methods described in the
[Element](../../../jme3/contributions/tonegodgui/element) class.
