Entity Systems are a new way of organising your game data.

The basic idea comes from the famous t-machine article about entity
systems as a possibility for mmorpg development. Zay-ES is pspeed's
Entity System which he uses for his game Mythruna. Entity Systems aim to
make your project more clear and dynamic.
