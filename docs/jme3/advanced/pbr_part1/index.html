a few weeks, because that&#x27;s what all the cool kids are talking about
these days. I read almost all the interweb about it and finally somehow
wrapped my head around the mechanics behind the concept.</p><p>None of the papers I read gave me the epiphany though, the understanding
came little by little, literally reading some of the papers 10 times.</p><p>The intent of this series of posts is first to brush up the concept of
PBR from the artist point of view (the easy part :D), and then to
explain the physical concepts behind it and what you have to understand
as a developer.</p><p>This paper aims to present PBR as I would explain it to my mother. You
shouldn&#x27;t need a degree in image rendering theories, neither should you
need to be a genius to understand what&#x27;s coming.</p><p>There are a lot of papers out there, with a lot of complicated words and
equations, that assume a solid background knowledge of image rendering,
lighting, shading etc...</p><p>I won&#x27;t assume this here.</p><p>Of course, I&#x27;d like this to be as accurate as possible, so if you have
more information, or if explanations are not clear, feel free to chime
in.</p><p><strong>I&#x27;m an artist, I want to know what PBR is :</strong></p><p>So you&#x27;re an artist, and have some experience in making assets for
games. The most commonly used model for describing a material is the
Phong reflection model (from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bui_Tuong_Phong">Bui Tuong
Phong</a>, a clever guy that
died very young).</p><p>This model describes how light reflects on a material by splitting it in
3 factors: Ambient color, Diffuse color, Specular color. This should
sound familiar to 3D game artists.</p><p>This model is a very rough approximation of what&#x27;s really going on when
light hit a surface of a real life material, but until then it was
pretty much enough for a video game. Of course there are dozens of other
models and even modification of Phong model, but this one is the most
used, and that&#x27;s the one we use in jMonkeyEngine.</p><p>The issue with this model is that it&#x27;s complicated to have a material
that looks consistent under different lighting environment.</p><ul><li><p>Ambient is supposed to represent Ambient lighting, being some sort
of omnipresent dim light, that tries to fake indirect lighting
coming from reflection of light on the surrounding objects.</p></li><li><p>Diffuse is more straightforward: it&#x27;s the actual color of the object
when it&#x27;s under a white light.</p></li><li><p>Specular represent the color of the reflected highlights, and the
intensity is driven by a &quot;shininess&quot; parameter (at least in jME but
that&#x27;s pretty common). The issue is that the specular color also
drives the intensity because the brighter the color the more intense
the specular will be.</p></li></ul><p>All of this leads to a lot of tweaking to look correct, and may not look
as good as it should under a different lighting environment. It also
relies heavily on an artist&#x27;s best guesses about the material.</p><p>So here comes Physically Based Rendering. Not that the previous one was
not physically based...but whatever, that sounds pretty cool.</p><p>Everybody has their own way to implement PBR, but every implementation
share common goals and concepts.</p><p><strong>Goals :</strong></p><ul><li><p>Ease the artist&#x27;s material workflow.</p></li><li><p>More &quot;photo realistic&quot; rendering.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Concepts :</strong></p><ul><li><p>Every surface has a reflection (specular); even the rougher ones at
grazing angles.</p></li><li><p>Energy conservation: a surface cannot reflect more light that it has
received.</p></li></ul><p>This wraps up the entire concept but how does it translate in practice?</p><p>A material can now be described with 3 parameters :</p><p><strong>Base color :</strong> Base color is the raw color of the material, it&#x27;s also
often referred as the Albedo. It&#x27;s similar to the Diffuse color you know
from Phong model, but with some crucial differences :</p><ul><li><p>It should not contain any shading information. Very often with phong
model, Ambient Occlusion (AO) is baked into the diffuse map. Here
Base color must be the raw color of the material</p></li><li><p>It does not only influence the diffuse color, but also the specular
color of the material.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Metalness :</strong> The degree of metallicity of the material. What does
that mean? is your material rather metallic or rather not (non metallic
materials are called dielectric materials in the literature). Some
implementation calls that parameter &quot;specular&quot;, but I found it pretty
misleading as it&#x27;s completely different as the specular we know today.
In practice, just start out with extreme values to get the feel for it:
1 for metallic, 0 for dielectric.</p><p><img src="/images/jme3/advanced/metalness.png" alt="metalness"></p><p>Here is the same material with metalness of 0 (dielectric) on the left
and 1 (metallic) on the right.</p><p>Of course there are intermediary values, but from my reading, most
dielectric material should vary from 0.04 and 0.1, and metallic are
usually 1. Those values are based on real life measures and you can find
some references about them
<a href="https://seblagarde.wordpress.com/2012/04/30/dontnod-specular-and-glossiness-chart/">here</a>
and
<a href="https://seblagarde.wordpress.com/2014/04/14/dontnod-physically-based-rendering-chart-for-unreal-engine-4/">here</a>.
Note that those values are not subject to interpretation, and are
&quot;known&quot; factors and artist may follow them if they want to keep
realistic look.</p><p><strong>Roughness :</strong> The degree of roughness of the material : Is your
material smooth or rough. 0 means smooth, 1 means rough. Some
implementations refer to this as Smoothness or Glossiness. That&#x27;s
essentially the same except it&#x27;s the other way around. 1 is smooth and 0
is rough. I find the term &quot;Roughness&quot; pretty much self explanatory and
doesn&#x27;t leave room for misinterpretation.</p><p><img src="/images/jme3/advanced/Roughness.png" alt="Roughness"></p><p>Here is the same material with different level of roughness from 0
(left) to 1 (right). As opposed to metalness, this parameter is very
artist driven. The roughness of a material does not really depend on
physics, it&#x27;s more related to micro scratches, wearing, etc... So that&#x27;s
where artists should be creative!</p><p>These parameters are the basics of PBR. Of course, each of them can be
stored in a texture, and more common additional parameters can be used.</p><p><strong>For example :</strong></p><ul><li><p>Normal map : the same as with phong model.</p></li><li><p>AO map : since we can&#x27;t bake AO in diffuse anymore, it&#x27;s now an
extra channel.</p></li></ul><p>The nice thing is that Metalness, Roughness and AO are grey scaled
textures, so basically they only use one channel of a texture. So you
can pack those 3 maps in one texture.</p><p>You can find an example asset that should work in a typical PBR
implementation <a href="http://artisaverb.info/PBT.html">here</a>. This page
showcases pretty well what the textures should look like.</p><p>That&#x27;s it for PBR from the artist point of view. Next week I&#x27;ll explain
what&#x27;s under the hood for you fellow developers 😉</p><p><strong>Updates (01/01/2015)</strong></p><p>Since this post I had some discussions about it and it appears, it lacks
some informations about the different art pipeline you may come across,
the differences and what to expect from them.</p><p>The post above is about the <strong>Metalness Workflow</strong>.</p><p>The question I had frequently about it is &quot;how one specify the specular
color if you just have a black and white metalness texture?&quot;.</p><p>The answer is you do in the albedo map.</p><p>In the metalness workflow the albedo map is used for both diffuse color
and specular color. When the metalness is zero (dielectric material) the
base color is the diffuse color of the material. When the metalness is
one (metallic material), the base color is the specular color.</p><p>So if you wonder what this base color should be, just look at it in the
most naive way. &quot;What color is that thing?&quot; and don&#x27;t care if that&#x27;s
diffuse or specular.</p><p>The other common workflow is called the <strong>Specular workflow</strong> as it uses
a specular color map instead of the metalness map. In this workflow, the
albedo map is the diffuse color, the specular map is the specular color,
and you have a gray scale gloss map that is the same as the roughness
map but inverted (1 is smooth and 0 is rough).</p><p>Now there are pro and cons on using one or the other. Here are the main
points :</p><h1><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_ZqCz" id="metalness-workflow-"></a><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#metalness-workflow-" title="Direct link to heading">#</a>Metalness workflow :</h1><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li><p>Use less texture space. Albedo map is an rgba map, metal and
roughness can be packed in another rgba map and you have 2
additional channels for whatever you want (AO, cavity, ...w/e)</p></li><li><p>Harder to make implausible materials (some may see this as a con
thought). it&#x27;s not more physically accurate, but you&#x27;re sure to
follow the energy conservation paradigm.</p></li><li><p>Easier color concept : base color is the color of the material.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li><p>May produce some white artifacts at the junction between metal and
non metal</p></li><li><p>Harder to make implausible materials, not impossible though.</p></li></ul><h1><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_ZqCz" id="specular-workflow"></a><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#specular-workflow" title="Direct link to heading">#</a>Specular workflow</h1><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Closer to the current phong workflow : diffuse map, specular map.
Must be easier for seasoned artists to transition to PBR.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li><p>You&#x27;re in charge of the energy conservation paradigm (may be seen as
a + for some).</p></li><li><p>More memory used : 2 rgba textures for diffuse and specular, you may
be able to pack glossiness in the alpha channel of specular map, but
you have no room left for anything and you may have to use a third
texture.</p></li></ul><p>IMO, the metalness workflow is more suited to real time 3D engine. And
as an artist I find it more intuitive.</p><p>That said, as a developer making his PBR pipeline; especially for an
engine mainly used by Indie devs; whatever pipeline you choose, you
can&#x27;t ignore the other. Free or charged PBR ready model you can find are
done with whatever workflow suited the artist. Some conversion are
possible, but that&#x27;s easier for user to be able to use the model as is.
That&#x27;s why I decided to support both in my implementation.</p><ul><li><p><a href="/wikidemo/docs/jme3/advanced/pbr_part2">Physically Based Rendering -- Part
