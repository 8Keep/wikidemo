Positioning the Camera
======================

You can steer the camera using
[Cinematics](../../jme3/advanced/cinematics):

1.  Create a Cinematic.

2.  Create a CameraNode and bind the camera object to the Cinematic.
    Note that we also give the camera node a name in this step.

    ```java
    CameraNode camNode = cinematic.bindCamera("topView", cam);
    ```

3.  Position the camera node in its start location.

4.  Use activateCamera() to give the control of the camera to this node.
    You now see the scene from this camera's point of view. For example
    to see through the camera node named "topView, 6 seconds after the
    start of the cinematic, you'd write

    ```java
    cinematic.activateCamera(6, "topView");
    ```

Code Sample
-----------

```java
flyCam.setEnabled(false);
Cinematic cinematic = new Cinematic(rootNode, 20);

CameraNode camNodeTop = cinematic.bindCamera("topView", cam);
camNodeTop.setControlDir(ControlDirection.SpatialToCamera);
camNodeTop.getControl(0).setEnabled(false);

CameraNode camNodeSide = cinematic.bindCamera("sideView", cam);
camNodeSide.setControlDir(ControlDirection.CameraToSpatial);
camNodeSide.getControl(0).setEnabled(false);
```

Moving the Camera
=================

If desired, attach the camNode to a MotionEvent to let it travel along
waypoints. This is demonstrated in the
[TestCameraMotionPath.java](https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/blob/master/jme3-examples/src/main/java/jme3test/animation/TestCameraMotionPath.java)
example.
