Here is an example for how you add a static horizon (a background
landscape and a sky) to a scene. Having a discernable horizon with a
suitable landscape (or space, or ocean, or whatever) in the background
makes scenes look more realistic than just a single-colored "sky"
background.

Adding the Sky
==============

Adding a sky is extremely easy using the `com.jme3.util.SkyFactory`.

```java
getRootNode().attachChild(SkyFactory.createSky(getAssetManager(), "Textures/Sky/Bright/BrightSky.dds", SkyFactory.EnvMapType.CubeMap));
```

To add a sky you need to supply:

1.  The assetManager object to use

2.  A cube or sphere map texture of the sky

3.  Set the map type:
    [SkyFactory.EnvMapType]({link-javadoc}/com/jme3/util/SkyFactory.EnvMapType.html).
    In this instance, CubeMap.

Internally, the SkyFactory calls the following methods:

1.  `sky.setQueueBucket(Bucket.Sky);` makes certain the sky is rendered
    in the right order, behind everything else.

2.  `sky.setCullHint(Spatial.CullHint.Never);` makes certain that the
    sky is never culled.

3.  The SkyFactory uses the internal jME3 material definition
    `Sky.j3md`. This Material definition works with sphere and cube
    maps.

Creating the Textures
=====================

As the sky texture we use the sample BrightSky.dds file from
jme3test-test-data.

How to create a sky textures?

-   There are many tools out there that generate cube and sphere maps.\
    Examples for landscape texture generators are Terragen or Bryce.

-   The actual texture size does not matter, as long as you add the Sky
    Geometry to the Sky bucket: Everything in the sky bucket will always
    be infinitely far away behind everything else, and never intersect
    with your scene.\
    Of course the higher the resolution, the better it will look. On the
    other hand, if the graphic is too big, it will slow the game down.

-   A box or sphere map is the simplest solution. But you can use any
    Node as sky, even complex sets of geometries and quads with animated
    clouds, blinking stars, city skylines, etc.

-   JME3 supports cube maps in PNG, JPG, or (compressed) DDS format.

Box or Sphere?

-   If you have access to cube map textures, then use a SkyBox

-   If you have access to sphere map textures -- specially projected sky
    images that fit inside a sphere -- then you use a SkySphere or
    SkyDome.
