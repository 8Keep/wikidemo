Before exporting your Blender models, its is recommended that you clean
the buffers of any unneeded `Action`, `Material`, `Texture` or
`UV Image`. This is a straight forward process that only takes a few
minutes. Failure to do so can lead you into a morass of problems, like
having more than one AnimControl, duplicate materials and textures,
wasted space from worthless images, just to mention a few potential
troubles.

Material, Texture, UV Image Buffers
===================================

1.  Open the `UV Image Editor`, `Material Tab` or `Texture Tab`.

2.  Select the Browse button located next to the material, texture or UV
    Image name to load the item to be cleared.

3.  While holding Shift down, click the X button, also known as the
    Unlink datablock button, located next to the loaded item. An item
    that is unlinked will show a `0` before it when viewed by selecting
    the Browse button and will not be saved if you exit Blender.

4.  Save your file.

5.  From the `Info` header select `File Open Recent Your Saved File`, to
    close and re-open your file.

The exception to this rule is the `Linked Action` buffer, for
animations, located in the `Dope Sheet Editor`.

The Linked Action Buffer
========================

1.  In the `Dope Sheet Editor`, change the context to `Action Editor`.

2.  Click the `Action to be linked` button and select the action you
    want cleared.

3.  Deselect the F button to prevent it from saving.

4.  Change the editor type from `Dope Sheet` to `NLA Editor`. You will
    see the action listed.

5.  Click the ![angle double down](./images/icons/angle-double-down.png)
    button next to the action to push it into the stack.

6.  Click the small start next to the track name.

7.  With the mouse inside the `NLA Track List`,Â  press X to delete both
    the track and strip.

8.  Save your file.

9.  From the `Info` header, select `File Open Recent Your Saved File`.

10. Save your file again.

11. From the `Info` header, select `File Open Recent Your Saved File`
    again.

12. Change back to the `Dope Sheet Editor`.

13. Click the Browse Action to be linked button and you will see only
    the baked action remains and the buffer is now clear of unwanted
    actions. Select your action.

14. Save your file.
