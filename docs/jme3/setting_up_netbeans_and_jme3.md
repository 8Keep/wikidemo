For development with the jMonkeyEngine 3, we recommend to use the
jMonkeyEngine [SDK](../sdk).

Alternatively, you can use your favorite IDE: In this tutorial we show
how to download and set up the latest nightly build of the jMonkeyEngine
3 for use with the NetBeans IDE. Instructions for
[Eclipse](../jme3/setting_up_jme3_in_eclipse) are also available.

::: {.important}
Note that the jMonkeyEngine SDK is built in top of the NetBeans
Platform, and is identical to the NetBeans IDE for Java (plus some
unique NetBeans plugins). Basically it's redundant and unnecessary to
set up jME for NetBeans -- but if you want to, it's easily possible.
:::

Downloading jME3
================

The currently available JAR binaries are the nightly builds.

1.  Download the most recent zipped build from
    <https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/releases>

2.  Unzip the file and save it as `jME3.2-stable` in your
    NetBeansProjects directory. You should see the following files and
    directories:

    a.  `lib/` - The jMonkeyEngine binaries and libraries. (Don't
        remove.)

    b.  `jMonkeyEngine3.jar` -- Run this executable jar file to see
        various feature demos. (optional)

    c.  `javadoc/` - jME3 API documentation. (optional)

    d.  `sources/` - jME3 source files. (optional)

Creating a Project
==================

In NetBeans, choose `File New Project`, select `Java Java Application`,
click Next.

-   Project Name: HelloJME3

-   Project Location: \~/NetBeansProjects

-   Create main() Class: Yes

-   Click Finish

The new project appears in the Projects window.

Setting up Dependencies
=======================

Your project depends on the jMonkeyEngine libraries and needs to know
where they are. We will create a global library so you can use it for
other projects without having to re-configure everything. You only do
this one time.

1.  In the Projects window of the HelloJME3 project, RMB click the
    project's `Libraries` node and choose `Add Library`.

2.  In the `Add Library` dialog, click the Create button.

3.  For the `Library Name` enter "jME3.2-stable".

4.  For the `Library Type` select `Class Libraries`.

5.  Click OK and the `Customize Library` dialog will open.

6.  In the `Classpath` tab, click the Add Jar/Folder button and navigate
    to the `lib/` directory located in your
    `~/NetBeansProjects/jME3.2-stable` folder. .  Select all JARs in
    `lib/` and when done click the Add Jar/Folder button.

    -   Optional: Configuring the `Source File`  editor for NetBeans.

        -   In the `Sources` tab, click the Add Jar/Folder button and
            navigate to the `sources/` directory located in your
            `~/NetBeansProjects/jME3.2-stable` folder. \*\*  Select all
            JARs in `sources/` and when done click the Add Jar/Folder
            button.

    -   Optional: Configuring the JavaDoc Popups in NetBeans. 

        -   In the `Javadoc` tab, click the Add ZIP/Folder button and
            navigate to the `javadoc/` folder located in your
            `~/NetBeansProjects/jME3.2-stable` folder.

        -   Select the `javadoc/` folder but do not enter the directory,
            the `File Name` will change to `javadoc`. Click the Add
            ZIP/Folder button to close the dialog.

7.  Click the OK button, next click the Add Library to create the
    library.

The necessary libraries are now on the classpath and should appear in
the Libraries list. You now have a global library you can add to any
project.

::: {.note}
If you configured your library with sources and javadocs, open a class
of your HelloJME3 project, place the caret into a jme3 class, and press
Ctrl + Space to see the javadoc popup, as well as code-completion.

To open the source file editor, RMB click on any jME3 class or method,
then select `Navigate Go To Source`.

Build & Run Tips in NetBeans
============================

How to build and run in NetBeans:

-   Clean and build the whole project by pressing Shift + F11.

-   Run any file that is open in the editor and has a main() class by
    pressing Shift + F6.

-   Run the Main class of the project by pressing F6.

Tips for configuring the main class in NetBeans:

-   RMB select the HelloJME3 project and choose "Set as main project".
    Now you can use the toolbar buttons (clean&build, run, debug, etc)
    to control this project.

-   RMB select the HelloJME3 project and choose `Properties`. Go to the
    `Run` section.

    -   Under Main Class, specify the class that will be executed when
        you run the whole project. For now, enter `hellojme3.HelloJME3`.

Writing a SimpleApplication
===========================

You can now continue to write [your first jme3
application](../jme3/beginner/hello_simpleapplication)!
