This documentation wiki contains installation and configuration guides,
jME coding tutorials and other information that will help you get your
game project going. You can search the contents of this wiki using the
“Wiki” menu search box at the top of each page.

You are also very welcome to fix mistakes or spelling as well as unclear
paragraphs using the “Wiki” menu “Edit” ![pencil

square](/wikidemo/images/icons/plus-square.png) buttons. You have to be logged

contributing under the [Contribute](#contribute#) heading.

This is an Admonition. You will see many of these scattered throughout
the Wiki. See the [Admonition Definitions](wiki/admonitions) for the

# Forum

The [forum](http://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/) is your first stop when
reporting bugs, making contributions, discussing wiki content, or
anything else that you can’t get the answer for by reading the wiki or
searching the forum archives. You will find it to be a friendly and
inviting place to have discussions, but before posting, there are two
minor rules you will need to observe.

1.  For questions that include code, learn [how to use code
    blocks](https://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/t/how-to-type-code-blocks/31155).
    If you fail to do so, you will at best be reminded of your lapse in
    judgment and may not receive an answer to your question at all
    otherwise. See the [Github Tips](github_tips) page for info on
    how to insert links into your posts.

2.  [Uploading pictures is
    disabled](https://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/t/uploading-pictures-and-changing-avatars-is-disabled/39520)
    with the exception of a 50k disk space allowance for a forum avatar.

\* The SDK creates Ant-based projects that any Java IDE can import. We
recommend users of other IDEs to also download the jMonkeyEngine SDK and
choose `File Import Project External Project Assets` to create a
codeless project for managing assets only. This way you can code in the
IDE of your choice, and use the SDK to convert your models to .j3o
format.
