title: Report Bugs

Even if you cannot contribute patches and plugins, you can still help a
lot by reporting bugs and helping us improve existing features.

To file a bug report, you must have a [github
account](https://github.com/). If that’s something you are strongly
opposed to, you may file a report by posting in our [forum for
jME3](https://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/). We do highly prefer the Github
issue tracker though. Note that for troubleshooting, the forum is the
preferred way.

# Filing a new issue to github

1.  Navigate to [jMonkeyEngine’s issues
    list](https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues).

2.  Carefully search through existing jME3 issues. Is your issue not
    listed? Please continue.

3.  Press the `new issue` button in the top right corner, or use this
    direct link to [file a new
    issue](https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues/new).

4.  Fill in the form using the bug report template bellow, and click on
    "Submit new issue" when you’re done.

# Filing a new issue in the ‘contribution depot’

You need a registered account on [our
forum](https://hub.jmonkeyengine.org) to post a new thread.

  - Then go to [jME3 Contribution
    Depot](https://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/c/contribution-depot-jme3)
