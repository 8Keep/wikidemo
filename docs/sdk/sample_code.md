You can run example code by opening an included JME3Tests project and
included assets. You can also search the built-in documentation or drag
and drop code snippets from the Palette in the SDK to get short code
sample.

Code Palette and Samples in the SDK
===================================

-   Type a keyword into the search box in the SDK or press F1 to search
    the built-in help for sample code.

-   [SDK code editor and palette](../sdk/code_editor)

The JME3Tests Project Template
==============================

The jMonkeyEngine SDK contains a Test Project with lots of sample code
and assets. The Test Project is all set up and ready to run, and it's
easy to use for beginners (no need to mess with classpaths or
libraries).

1.  Install and Open the jMonkeyEngine [SDK](../sdk).

2.  Go to `File New Project`.

3.  In the New Project Wizard, select `JME3 Tests` from the `JME3`
    category. Click `Next`.

4.  Specify a location, e.g. create a jMonkeyProjects directory in your
    home directory. Click `Finish`.

This default project template creates a project called `JmeTests`. It
contains all test classes and examples from the jme3 source repository.
Feel free to modify the code samples and experiment! In the unlikely
event that you should break the project, emoji:smiley\[\] you can always
recreate all packaged samples by creating another project from the New
Project wizard's `JME3 Tests` template.

If you're using the 3.1.0-Stable+ version of the SDK, you will need to
set the `Source/Binary Format` from the `Project Properties` window to
Java 1.7 or later.

-   To change the source, `RMB` select the jmeTestProject and then
    select `Properties Sources Source/Binary Format`, or from the File
    menu, with the jmeTestProject selected,
    `File Project Properties Sources Source/Binary Format`.

You will also need to remove the `jme3-jbullet` library and add
`jme3-bullet` and `jme3-bullet-native` libraries.

-   From the `Project Properties` window select `Libraries` and then the
    `Compile` tab. Under `Compile-time Libraries` select `jme3-jbullet`
    and press `Remove`. Press `Add Library`, select the two libraries
    `jme3-bullet` and `jme3-bullet-native` while holding Ctrl and then
    press `Add Library` and finally `OK`.

::: {.important}
Press Shift + F6 to run a class that is open in the editor, or `RMB` a
class in the Project window and choose `Run File`. You can run the
`TestChooser` app by `RMB` selecting the project and pressing `Run`. The
TestChooser app allows you to easily navigate through all the test
cases.

JME3TestData Assets
===================

You may want access to some sample assets, such as 3D models or
textures, in one of your projects. A common situation for this would be
while going through the [beginner
tutorials](../jme3.xml#tutorials-for-beginners#).

1.  RMB select an existing jME3 project in the [SDK](../sdk), and
    select Properties.

2.  In the Properties window, select the `Libraries` section. Go to the
    `Compile` tab, it contains `Compile-time Libraries`.

3.  Click the Add Library button and select the pre-defined
    `jme3-test-data`. Click OK.

4.  Click OK to save and close the Properties.

The project's assetManager now has access to sample files from the
`jme3-test-data.jar` file. This JAR library contains

-   Ogre XML Models: Ninja.mesh.xml, Oto.mesh.xml, HoverTank.mesh.xml,
    Sinbad.mesh.xml, and many more

-   Blender models

-   Materials and Textures

    -   Terrain, sky, rock, brick, pond...

    -   Particle effect textures

-   Sounds

-   And more...

AssetPacks
==========

![assetpackbrowser-300x166.jpg](../sdk/assetpackbrowser-300x166.jpg)

If you need sample 3D models, don't miss the opportunity to download our
community-provided [Asset Packs](../sdk/asset_packs)!

In the SDK:

-   Open the AssetPackBrowser from the Windows menu

-   In the AssetPackBrowser, click the Online AssetPacks button

-   Click Install on the AssetPack of your choice. The SDK downloads it
    and makes the assets accessible in your AssetPack Library.

-   Click the View Library button and open the Assets node.

-   RMB select an asset to

    -   Preview it

    -   Add it to the SceneComposer

    -   Add it to a game project's assets directory

share your own collection with the community.
