Best results when car is facing in z direction (towards you).

Usage
=====

1.  Select a j3o that contains a vehicle model and press the vehicle
    button (or right-click → edit vehicle)

2.  The VehicleCreator automatically adds a PhysicsVehicleControl to the
    rootNode of the model if there is none

3.  Select the Geometry or Node that contains the chassis in the
    SceneExplorer and press "create hull shape from selected

4.  Select a Geometry that contains a wheel and press "make selected
    spatial wheel, select the "front wheel checkboxes for front wheels

5.  Do so for all wheels

New wheels will get the current suspension settings, you can edit single
wheels via the SceneExplorer (update VehicleControl if wheels dont show
up) or apply settings created with the settings generator to wheel
groups.

Press the "test vehicle button to drive the vehicle, use WASD to
control, Enter to reset.

Known Issues
============

Don't save while testing the vehicle, you will save the location and
acceleration info in the j3o.

Code Sample
===========

Code Example to load vehicle:

```java
//load vehicle and access VehicleControl
Spatial car=assetManager.loadModel("Models/MyCar.j3o");
VehicleControl control=car.getControl(VehicleControl.class);
rootNode.attachChild(car);
physicsSpace.add(control);
 
//then use the control to control the vehicle:
control.setPhysicsLocation(new Vector3f(10,2,10));
control.accelerate(100);
```
