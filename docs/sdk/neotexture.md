The NeoTextureEditor allows creating tiled textures procedurally using a
simple node interface for generating images, blending them, creating
normal maps and much more. You can directly load the .tgr files as a
material or export the generated images as .png files and use them in a
jMonkeyEngine-based game.

Textures usually make up most of the size of a game distribution. This
is why NeoTexture is not only an editor, but also a library that
generates textures from .tgr files. Use the library to load .tgr files
directly in jME3 as a material, without having to export the textures
before. This means high-quality textures for your models, but just tiny
description files in your distribution.

Creating and Editing a NeoTexture file
======================================

1.  Right-click the `assets/Textures` directory and choose New... \>
    Other.

2.  In the New File Wizard, choose NeoTexture \> Empty NeoTextureFile
    and click Next.

3.  Give the file a name, for exmaple `neoMaterial`.

4.  A new file `neoMaterial.tgr` is created in the Textures directory
    and opens in the NeoTexture Editor.

Edit the .tgr file and create your procedural texture: ([Learn more
about creating Procedural Textures
here](http://neotextureedit.sourceforge.net/))

1.  Drag any pattern from the left bar to the editor area.

2.  Right-click the editor area and paste a NormalMap filter node.

3.  Connect the green output mark of the pattern with the red input mark
    of the filter. +This generates a Normal Map that can be used as bump
    map.

Adding the NeoTexture libraries to your project
===============================================

To use NeoTexture tgr files directly in your application, you have to
add the NeoTexture libraries to your project:

1.  Right-click your project and select "Properties

2.  Go to the "Libraries section of the properties window

3.  Press "Add Library..

4.  Select "NeoTexture-Libraries and press "add

Loading tgr files as material
=============================

We want to use the procedural texture as a material based on
`Lighting.j3md` (the default). We know that Lighting.j3md supports
DiffuseMap, NormalMap, SpecularMap, and ParallaxMap.

1.  Click the Normal Map filter to select it. We want to use it as the
    Normal Map of the texture.

    a.  In the NeoTextures Properties window under `Export name`, enter
        the name of the texture layer as it would appear in a .j3m file,
        e.g. "NormalMap".

2.  Click the pattern to select it. We want to (re)use it as Diffuse Map
    of the texture.

    a.  In the NeoTextures Properties window under `Export name`, enter
        the name of the texture layer as it would appear in a .j3m file,
        e.g. "DiffuseMap".

3.  Click the Save button in the NeoTextures Editor. The .tgr file is
    saved with two layers. (We could add SpecularMap and ParallaxMap the
    same way, if we wanted.)

Let's assign the newly created texture to a mesh to see what it looks
like.

1.  Open your Main.java file.

2.  Choose Window→Palette to open the Palette. You will find two
    NeoTexture code snippets, one for adding the NeoTexture loader to
    the assetManager, and one for loading a NeoTexture material.

3.  Drag&Drop one of each into the simpleInitApp() method of your
    application.

4.  Adjust the .tgr file path names to match the file that we just
    created: "Materials/neoMaterial.tgr.

Clean, build and run. You're ready to load your procedural material!

```java
assetManager.registerLoader(com.jme3.material.plugins.NeoTextureMaterialLoader.class,"tgr");
NeoTextureMaterialKey key = new NeoTextureMaterialKey("Materials/neoMaterial.tgr");

Material mat = assetManager.loadAsset(key);
mat.setFloat("Shininess",12); /* Lighting.j3md has non-map parameters too that we can set. */
thing.setMaterial(mat);
```

The default Material Definition for NeoTextures is `Lighting.j3md`, and
it's probably the one you will use most often. In case that you want to
use additional texture parameters, other than DiffuseMap, SpecularMap,
ParallaxMap, and NormalMap, you can switch to another Material
Definition using setMaterialDef(), for instance:

```java
key.setMaterialDef("Commons/MatDefs/Misc/ColoredTextured.j3md");
```

Remember that the layer names in the .tgr file must match the ones
declared in the .j3md file. In our example of `ColoredTextured.j3md`,
the .tgr file must contain a `ColorMap` and you need to set a RGBAColor.

Using tgr files like normal textures in j3m files
=================================================

You can use the .tgr files like normal textures in j3m files, with a
syntax like this: `Materials/neoMaterial?DiffuseMap.tgr` The part
between the `?` and the suffix is the name of the node you want to load
as a texture. If you dont supply a name, `texture` is used.

To be able to load these textures, you have to register a Locator and a
Loader in the AssetManager, note that you can only register one loader
per extension so you cannot load .tgr files as materials and as textures
with the same assetManager.

```java
assetManager.registerLocator("/", com.jme3.texture.plugins.NeoTextureLocator.class );
assetManager.registerLoader(com.jme3.texture.plugins.NeoTextureLoader.class,"tgr");
```
