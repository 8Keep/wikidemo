The jMonkeyEngine SDK makes it easy to get started with developing 3-D
games based on the jMonkeyEngine.

Creating a New jMonkeyEngine Project
====================================

1.  Choose `File New Project` from the main menu.

2.  In the New Project Wizard, select the template `JME3 Basic Game`.

3.  Click next to specify a project name, and the path where to store
    your new project.

4.  Click Finish. A skeleton application is created and opens in the
    Project Explorer.

    -   This basic jme3 application is based on the SimpleApplication
        class to allow an easy start with jme3.

    -   You can click the run button to run it: You will see a blue
        cube.

Project Structure
-----------------

![jmonkeyplatform-docu-4.png](../sdk/jmonkeyplatform-docu-4.png)

Let's have a look at the abstract project structure in the Project
Explorer. (Ctrl+1).

-   **Project Assets node:** These directories have been created for you
    to store your games assets, such as fonts, materials, models,
    shaders, sounds, and textures. For a newly created project, these
    directories are empty.

-   **Source Packages node:** This is where you manage your packages and
    classes. For a newly created project, it contains one package and
    one class, `Main.java`. Double click `Main.java` to open it in the
    editor.

-   **Libraries node:** An overview of all libraies on your game's
    classpath. The classpath is already set-up for the jme3 framework
    (including LWJGL, Bullet, Nifty GUI, etc).

Directory Structure
-------------------

Now let's have a look at the project's file structure in the File
Explorer (Ctrl+2). This explorer shows the physical directory structure
on your hard drive.

-   **assets** -- This directory corresponds to the Project Assets node.
    It is needed for the assetManager.

    This is the recommended internal structure:

    -   `assets/Interface`

    -   `assets/MatDefs`

    -   `assets/Materials`

    -   `assets/Models`

    -   `assets/Scenes`

    -   `assets/Shaders`

    -   `assets/Sounds`

    -   `assets/Textures`

-   **src** -- This directory corresponds to the Source Packages node.
    Your sources code goes here.

-   **nbproject** -- This is meta data used by the jMonkeyEngine SDK
    (don't edit).

-   **build.xml** -- This is an Ant build script that is hooked up to
    the clean/build/run/test actions in the jMonkeyEngine SDK. It loads
    a default build script, and allows you to further customize the
    build process. The Ant script also assures that you are able to
    clean/build/run/test your application outside of the jMonkeyEngine
    SDK -- e.g. from the command line.

-   **build** -- This directory contains the compiled classes. (Will be
    generated by the jMonkeyEngine SDK when you build the project.)

-   **dist** -- This directory contains the executable JAR files. (Will
    be generated by the jMonkeyEngine SDK when you build the project.)

-   **test** -- The jMonkeyEngine SDK will store JUnit tests here if you
    create any. (Optional.)

Project Configuration
---------------------

\[RMB\] select the project and from the menu open the project
`Properties`.

-   In the `Run` section:

    -   Specify the main class of your project. (Pressing F6 runs this
        main class.)

    -   You can optionally configure JVM options and command line
        parameters. In most cases, set the `-Xms VMOption [NUMBER] m`
        for the memory usage.

        -   For example (-Xms500m).

        -   see <http://performance.netbeans.org/howto/jvmswitches/>).

-   In the Application section:

    -   Specify the game title (by default the game will be named
        `BasicGame`).

    -   Specify the vendor name (your name), a short description, your
        project's homepage, and a splash screen.

Clean, Build and Run Cycle
--------------------------

![jmonkeyplatform-docu-5.png](../sdk/jmonkeyplatform-docu-5.png)

::: {.important}
Pressing **F6 builds & runs** the *main* class of the *main project*. If
there are several classes, or several projects, you have to specify
which one you want F6 to run. RMB select a project and choose
`Set As Main Project`, then RMB select the project again and choose
`Properties Run` and choose a Main Class.

To build and run the main() of *any file that is open in the editor*,
press Shift+F6!
:::

-   RMB select the project and use the context-menu to clean all
    generated classes and JARs.

-   RMB select individual files with a main method to build and run
    them. (Shift+F6)

-   Press the Run button (green arrow in the toolbar) to build and run
    the project. (F6)

**More than one project open?** The toolbar buttons and the F-keys are
bound to the main project, which is shown in bold in the Project
Explorer. RMB select a project and select `Set As Main Project` to make
it respond to the toolbar buttons and F-keys.

**Worried About Proprietary Lock-in?** You are never locked into the
jMonkeyEngine SDK: At any time, you can change into your project
directory on the command line, and clean, build, and run your project,
using non-proprietary Apache Ant commands:

    ant clean; ant jar; ant run;

Development Process
===================

-   **Creating new files and packages:** Select the Source Packages node
    (or any of its subnodes), and press Ctrl+N (`File New File`): Use
    the `New File` wizard to create new Java classes, Java packages,
    Java beans, Swing forms, JUnit files, j3m Materials, j3o scenes, j3f
    filters, and many more.

-   **Editing files:** Open the Projects Explorer and double-click a
    Java file from the Source Packages to open it in the Editor. The
    [jMonkeyEngine SDK Code Editor](../sdk/code_editor) assists you
    in many ways, including syntactic and semantic code coloring, code
    completion, and javadoc.

-   **Adding Assets:**

    -   You can [import models, scenes, and
        materials](../sdk/model_loader_and_viewer) as assets into
        your project.

    -   To add sound files and images, use your operating system's file
        explorer and copy the files into your project's asset directory.

-   **ToDo List:** The tasks window automatically lists all lines
    containing errors and warnings, and all lines that you have marked
    with the comment keywords

    ``` {.html}
    FIXME
    ```

    , \@todo, or TODO.

-   **Integrated tools:** [Debugging, Testing,
    Profiling](../sdk/debugging_profiling_testing).

Adding external jar libraries
-----------------------------

You may want to use external Java libraries in your jME project, for
example content generators or artificial intelligence implementations.

Add the library to the global library list:

-   Select [Tools \> Libraries]{.menuchoice} in the main menu.

-   Click "New Library", enter a name for the library, and press OK.

-   In the "Classpath" tab, press "Add JAR/Folder" and select the jar
    file(s) needed for the library.

-   (Optional) In the "JavaDoc" tab, press "Add ZIP/Folder" and select
    the javadoc for the library, as zip file or folder.

-   (Optional) In the "Sources" tab you can select a folder or jar file
    containing the source files of the library.

-   Press OK.

Add the library to a project:

-   RMB select your project and select "Properties".

-   Select "Libaries" on the left and then press "Add Library".

-   Select the library from the list and press OK.

That's it, your project can now use the external library. If you also
linked the javadoc and sources, the SDK will assist you with javadoc
popups, code completion (Ctrl+Space) and source navigation (Ctrl+LMB ).

Application Deployment
----------------------

-   You can [deploy](../sdk/application_deployment) your game as
    desktop application (JAR), browser applet, WebStart (JNLP), or on
    the Android platform.

Running Sample Projects
=======================

The SDK contains [Sample Code](../sdk/sample_code) (read more).

Open the Source Packages node of the JmeTests project.

-   RMB select the `JME3Tests` project and choose Run.\
    Choose samples from the TestChooser and try out the included demos.

-   Browse a demo's source code in the SDK's Project window to learn how
    a feature is implemented and used.

-   Feel free to modify the code samples and experiment! If you break
    something, you can always recreate the packaged samples from the
    `JME3 Tests` template.
