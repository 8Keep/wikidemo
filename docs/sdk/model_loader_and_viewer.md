The jMonkeyEngine SDK imports models from your project and stores them
in the assets folder. The imported models are converted to a jME3
compatible binary format called .j3o. Double-click .j3o files in the
jMonkeyEngine SDK to display them in the SceneViewer, or load them
in-game using the AssetManager.

Presently, [Blender 3D](http://www.blender.org/) is the preferred
modelling tool for jME3 as it is also Open-Source Software and an
exporter for GLTF files exists. View the 3D model [Supported External
File Types](../jme3/features.xml#supported-external-file-types) and
their export/conversion options for more info.

::: {.warning}
Blender no longer supports Ogre exporting as of version 2.8. It's highly
recommended that you export and convert files using the GLTF type. Ogre
will eventually be removed from this wiki.

Installing the OgreXML Exporter in Blender
==========================================

The jMonkeyEngine SDK includes a tool to install the correct exporter
tools in Blender to export OgreXML files. To install the exporter, do
the following:

1.  Select `Tools OgreXML Install Blender OgreXML` in the jMonkeyEngine
    SDK Menu.

2.  If you are presented a filechooser, select the folder where your
    blender scripts reside.

3.  Press "Install" in the window that opens.

Also check out [how to create compatible models in
blender](../jme3/external/blender) and [how to organize your
assets](../jme3/intermediate/multi-media_asset_pipeline).

Using the model files directly
==============================

![jmonkeyplatform-docu-2.png](../sdk/jmonkeyplatform-docu-2.png)

1.  Create a separate folder for each model in the `assets` folder of
    your project.

2.  Export the model created in Blender **to the `asset` folder of your
    project**,

3.  Make sure all textures used in the .blend file are in the assets
    folder of the project.

4.  Double-click the model or right-click and select "Convert to JME
    binary" from the context-menu.

5.  In the Projects Explorer Assets node you should see your model j3o
    file.

6.  Double-click it to view it in the SceneViewer.

7.  Click on the lightbulb to turn on the light if you cannot see your
    model.

:::note
It is important that you export the model file and its textures to the
correct assets folder before creating the j3o file because the paths for
textures (and possibly other things) will be stored as absolute (to the
assets folder root) when you convert that model. This means the texture
location should not change after the import.

If the SceneViewer doesn't work refer to [Troubleshooting jMonkeyEngine3
SDK](../sdk/troubleshooting).

Working With a Model
--------------------

-   Open `Windows SceneExplorer` to view sub-nodes of the model.

-   Open `Windows Properties` to view the properties of the model's
    nodes.

-   Click the cube button in the SceneViewer to toggle between Wireframe
    mode and Textured mode.

-   Click the lightbulb to view Materials that require a light source

Notes About Model Assets
------------------------

The original OgreXML `.mesh.xml`, `.scene`, `.material`, `.skeleton.xml`
or `.gltf` model files **will not be included** in the distribution
`assets.jar` file of your distributed game, they are only available in
the assets folder so you are able to recreate the `.j3o` file from the
original if you ever come to change it in blender and have to export it
again.

About the SceneViewer and SceneExplorer window
----------------------------------------------

The SceneViewer and SceneExplorer windows are shared among plugins to
save system resources. This means that you will have to keep an eye on
what plugin is using the scene right now and what you are actually
modifying in these windows.

Most plugins will deliver their own UI elements to modify the scene so
the SceneExplorer is more of a global tool. The simple SceneComposer
however heavily relies on its functions as other plugins might too in
the future.

About the projects AssetManager
===============================

Each jMonkeyEngine SDK project has its own internal AssetManager that
has the projects assets folder registered as a FileLocator. When the
project is run, the assets folder is compressed into a jar file and
added to the projects main jar classpath. This way the editors in
jMonkeyEngine SDK and the running game have the same asset folder
structure.

You might wonder why jMonkeyEngine SDK requires you to copy the model
that is to be converted to j3o into the assets folder before. The Model
Import Tool also copies the model and associated files to the project
directory before converting. To load the model it needs to be in a
folder (or jar etc..) that belongs to the projects AssetManager root. To
load a model from some other folder of the filesystem, that folder would
have to be added to the AssetManager root. If every folder that contains
a model was in the root of the AssetManager, all textures named
"hull.jpg" for example would be the same for the AssetManager and it
would only deliver the texture of the first model folder that was added.

To have a valid jME3 object, the paths to textures and other assets
belonging to the model have to be read with the correct, final path that
can then be stored in the j3o object. The j3o object will use those
paths when it is loaded with the AssetManager and it requires the
AssetManager to deliver the assets on those paths, this is why the
folder structure while converting has to be the same as when loading.
